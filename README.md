# Monte Carlo Domain Walls (MCDW)

Code for Monte Carlo simulations of domain walls formation on Cu2N/Cu(111).

For now, the code need a lot of refactoring, cleaning and documentations. I will clean, correct and organise in the next commits.

Hello Jan. This is the code that I wrote. It's a quickly written code and need to be clean up and organise better.
